# PhishGuard-
Chrome Extension for Phishing URL Detection
Problem Statement
Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent, posing a significant threat to individuals and organizations. Cybercriminals create fraudulent websites and URLs that appear legitimate, tricking users into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. This project aims to develop a Chrome extension that can effectively detect and protect users from phishing URLs in real-time, providing an additional layer of security against these malicious attempts.

Project
PhisX is a Chrome extension designed to detect and block phishing URLs in real-time, enhancing online security against sophisticated cyber threats.

Solution
Choosing a Dataset:

Identify and select a comprehensive dataset containing labeled URLs, distinguishing between legitimate and phishing URLs.
Training a Model:

Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training.
Implement and train machine learning classification algorithms to accurately distinguish between phishing and legitimate URLs.
Evaluate and fine-tune the model to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
Creating an API:

Develop a RESTful API using Flask to serve the trained machine learning model.
Ensure the API can receive URL input, process it using the ML model, and return the detection results in real-time.
Developing the Chrome Extension:

Design and implement a Chrome extension that interacts with the Flask API.
Ensure the extension can send URL data to the API and display alerts or block access when a phishing URL is detected.
Integrate user-friendly features for seamless interaction and effective real-time protection.
